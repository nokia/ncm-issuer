  server is specified as a parameter "ncmSERVER2" in issuer or cluster issuer yaml file
- Fixed misinterpretation in case of manually triggering rotation of a private key
- Fixed bug related to getting certificate object when the certificate name is long
- Added possibility to include certificate chain in ca.crt by setting "chainInSigner" in issuer or cluster issuer
  yaml file to "true"
- Added possibility to include only end-entity certificate in tls.crt by setting "onlyEECert" in issuer or cluster
  issuer yaml file to "true"
- Bumped Go from 1.17 to 1.19.6

Version 1.1.0 (Chart: 1.1.0, Image: 1.1.0)
- The Issuer and ClusterIssuer definitions are improved to use more user-friendly names and grouped into appropriate
  sections
- Improved NCM API selection mechanism
- Improved handling CSR statuses returned by NCM
- Helm chart is rewritten according to the rules given in the Helm documentation
- Added option to set HTTP client timeout
- Added option to set a time indicating how often NCM API(s) availability should be checked  (related to new NCM API
  selection mechanism)
- Added Prometheus support to allow monitoring of the total number of enrollment or renewal operations. Each of these
  operations also has metrics responsible for determining how many of them were successful or failed. The metrics
  attempt to reflect the number of CSRs or renewals sent to the NCM, if request is rejected or postponed by NCM,
  this state will be reflected as failure of the enrollment operation, while accepting and returning appropriate
  resource will result in successful enrollment or renewal operation (use the prefix "ncm_issuer" in Prometheus query
  to see all possible metrics)
- Added possibility to configure verbosity of logging
- Added sidecar for debugging purposes
- Fixed occasionally encountered data-races when accessing saved Issuer or ClusterIssuer config

Version 1.1.1 (Chart: 1.1.1, Image: 1.1.1)
- Changed the list of supported Kubernetes version to 1.24 - 1.29

Version 1.1.2 (Chart: 1.1.2, Image: 1.1.2)
- Support for setting notBefore and notAfter parameters in NCM certificate requests corresponding to suggested Duration
  parameter in cert-manager.io/v1 Certificate object kind. notBefore is set to the current time when cert is being 
  enrolled. Feature is available for NCM >= 24.11, in older release new parameters are ignored
- Added issuer .spec.caID/CASHREF validation, so there is an error presented if the user specifies wrongly 
  formatted value
- Bumped Go version to 1.22.10

Version 1.1.3 (Chart: 1.1.3, Image: 1.1.3)
- Changed the list of supported Kubernetes versions to 1.24 - 1.32

Version 1.1.4 (Chart: 1.1.4, Image: 1.1.4)
- Optimizations to resolve potential startup issues under various Kubernetes orchestrators
- Fixed container startup error under NCS 24.11
- Upgraded Go version used for building the binary and Docker image from 1.22.10 to 1.24.2
- Updated go.mod dependencies (Kubernetes API to 0.32, controller-runtime to 0.20.4, cert-manager to 1.17.1)
- Corrected cert-manager import paths throughout the codebase
- Resolved Fatalf non-constant format string warnings
- Switched to the new metrics server setup via the Metrics field
- Updated golangci-lint to v1.64.8
- Fixed Makefile quoting issues to support paths with spaces
- Improved error handling across Go code
- Enabled status subresource in the fake client for unit tests

Version 1.1.5 (Chart: 1.1.5, Image: 1.1.5)
- Implemented optional RBAC workaround which might be needed when cert-manager is installed via the OLM/operator (see certManagerRbac.operatorWorkaround.enable in values.yaml)
- Added support for Kubernetes 1.33 (supported versions: 1.24 - 1.33)
- Upgraded Go version used for building the binary and Docker image from 1.24.2 to 1.24.3
- Updated go.mod dependencies (Kubernetes API to 0.33, controller-runtime to 0.21, cert-manager to 1.17.2)

Version 1.1.6 (Chart: 1.1.6, Image: 1.1.6)
- Switched to Docker Buildx for reliable cross-platform image builds
- Switched from Scratch to Alpine image to play more nicely with different Kubernetes orchestrators (and to finally have a shell!)
- Added explicit command to start ncm-issuer binary in Helm's deployment.yaml to ensure consistent container startup across Kubernetes environments
- Updated ncm-issuer-utils troubleshooting container to 1.1.6 - it is still hanging around even though the regular one has a shell now, mainly due to better security posture and clear separation
- Added new troubleshooting tools to ncm-issuer-utils: procps-ng, lsof, vim-minimal, less, strace
- Stripped symbol and DWARF debug info to reduce Docker image binary size
- Upgraded Go version used for building the binary and Docker image from 1.24.3 to 1.24.4

- Separated chart version from image tag to avoid Harbor OCI overwrite
- Fixed Makefile to save both remote and local tags in Docker archive, improving compatibility with various Kubernetes orchestrators
- Fully qualify golang base image as docker.io/golang to avoid short-name resolution error in some dev envs
- Updated go.mod dependencies to bump cert-manager to 1.18.1
