# What's changed

ncm-issuer `1.1.2` introduces two new features and includes some small improvements.

## Features

* Support for setting notBefore and notAfter parameters in NCM certificate requests corresponding to suggested Duration parameter in cert-manager.io/v1 Certificate object kind. notBefore is set to the current time when cert is being enrolled. Feature is available for NCM >= `24.11`, in older release new parameters are ignored
* Added issuer `.spec.caID/CASHREF` validation, so there is an error presented if the user specifies wrongly formatted value

## Other

* Linting code improvements
* CI improvements
