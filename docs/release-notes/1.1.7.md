# What's changed

ncm-issuer `1.1.7`  is a maintenance release that resolves Harbor OCI tag collisions that could overwrite Helm charts and container images sharing the same tag.

## Improvements and fixes

* Separated chart version from image tag to avoid Harbor OCI overwrite
* Fixed Makefile to save both remote and local tags in Docker archive, improving compatibility with various Kubernetes orchestrators
* Fully qualify golang base image as docker.io/golang to avoid short-name resolution error in some dev envs

## Other

* Updated go.mod dependencies to bump cert-manager to 1.18.1
* CI workflows updated with cert-manager 1.18.1
