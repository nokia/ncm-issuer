# What's changed

ncm-issuer `1.2.0` adds outbound proxy support for NCM API calls and makes Helm upgrades resilient to cert-manager approver RBAC naming differences. It also aligns default cert-manager RBAC role naming in the chart for consistency.

## Improvements and fixes

- Enhanced HTTP(S) client transport configuration to honor standard proxy env vars (`HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY`) when calling NCM REST API
- Added Helm chart values to configure outbound proxy settings for the controller pod
- Made `helm upgrade` resilient to cert-manager approver RBAC name variations by preserving the already-installed `ClusterRoleBinding.roleRef` (which is immutable in Kubernetes). This prevents upgrade failures when the existing RBAC was created with different naming than chart defaults. Also aligned default `certManagerRbac.role` with `certManagerRbac.binding` for consistency in fresh installs
