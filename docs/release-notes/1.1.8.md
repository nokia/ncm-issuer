title: 1.1.8

# What's changed

ncm-issuer `1.1.8`  is a compatibility and robustness release that aligns `private key rotation` semantics with cert-manager `v1.18+`, enhances certificate operation logging and improves NCM API error handling. It also adds support for Kubernetes `1.34` and updates core dependencies and build tooling.

## Improvements and fixes

- **Fixed private key rotation policy handling** (certificate renewal loop) to align with cert-manager `>=1.18.0` changes. From this release onwards, omitting `.spec.privateKey.rotationPolicy` means **re-enrollment** (private key rotation) instead of renewal. This aligns ncm-issuer behaviour with cert-manager `v1.18.0+`, where the default rotation policy changed from `Never` to `Always`. If you require a true renew-with-same-key flow, set `.spec.privateKey.rotationPolicy` to `Never` explicitly
- Enhanced logging for certificate operations with improved certificate extraction utilities. Logs now include detailed certificate information such as **subject DN**, **serial number**, **validity period** (`notBefore`/`notAfter`), **SAN entries** (DNS names and IP addresses), **key type and size**, **signature algorithm**, **issuer details**, **operation type**, **issue duration** etc.
- Added support for **Kubernetes** `1.34` (supported versions: `1.24 - 1.34`)
- Improved resource management by ensuring proper cleanup of temporary files and HTTP response bodies to prevent resource leaks
- Added nil checks and improved error handling in **NCM API** operations
- Refactored code for improved clarity, including leader election configuration and type improvements
- Updated `ncm-issuer-utils` troubleshooting container to `1.1.8`
- Updated `go.mod` dependencies: **Kubernetes API** to `0.34`, **controller-runtime** to `0.22`, **cert-manager** to `1.19.1`
