title: 1.1.6
---

# What's changed

ncm-issuer `1.1.6`  is a maintenance release that resolves potential issue in NCS, decreases the image size, brings the shell to main container and updates the troubleshooting sidecar container.

## Improvements and fixes

* Switched from Scratch to Alpine image to play more nicely with different Kubernetes orchestrators (and to finally have a shell!)
* Decreased size of the whole tarball from ~27,5 MB to ~17 MB
* Switched to Docker Buildx for reliable cross-platform image builds
* Added explicit command to start ncm-issuer binary in Helm's deployment.yaml to ensure consistent container startup across Kubernetes environments
* Updated ncm-issuer-utils troubleshooting container to 1.1.6 - it is still hanging around even though the regular one has a shell now, mainly due to better security posture and clear separation
* Added new troubleshooting tools to ncm-issuer-utils: procps-ng, lsof, vim-minimal, less, strace

## Other

* Stripped symbol and DWARF debug info to reduce Docker image binary size
* Upgraded Go version used for building the binary and Docker image from 1.24.3 to 1.24.4
